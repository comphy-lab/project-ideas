  Physics of fluids with a glass of champagne
 \end{LARGE}

\section*{Description}
If one notices carefully a glass of champagne (see figure \ref{fig:champange}) or a carbonated beverage, the air bubble in the liquid rises due to buoyancy and reaches the liquid-air interface. The bubble sits at the interface for a while and then bursts, creating a cavity in the interface. Bubble bursting like this is observed in many real-life scenarios. This process is responsible for transporting aromatics from champagne and pathogens from contaminated water. Furthermore, bubbles bursting in oceans emit nuclei that are essential for cloud formation in our atmosphere. 

The newly formed cavity desires to flatten out due to surface tension effects, and capillary waves begin traveling to serve this purpose. However, traveling waves do more than flatten the cavity; they collide at the bottom of the cavity, creating a jet that breaks into vertically projected droplets; see figures \ref{Figure::Typical} \& \ref{Figure::Waves}. This phenomenon has been widely studied by \citet{duchemin2002jet, walls2015jet, deike2018dynamics, gordillo2019capillary}.

Nonetheless, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the influence of liquid properties, especially non-Newtonian effects of surrounding liquid on the overall dynamics. Bubble-bursting in non-Newtonian media is observed in several geophysical phenomena such as mudpots (see \citet{sanjay_lohse_jalaal_2021,balasubramanianBurstingBubbleElastoviscoplastic2024} and \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9hUsVq9q7U}{YouTube link}). In addition to its practical applications, bubble-bursting in non-Newtonian medium has great scientific relevance. For instance, understanding the bubble-bursting dynamics in a viscoelastic medium teaches us a great deal and paves the way for understanding much more complex flows, such as coughing or sneezing. Such a phenomenon involves the breaking of mucosalivary fluids (which shows viscoelastic behavior) into droplets that are primarily responsible for airborne disease transmission \citep{walls2017quantifying, bourouiba2021fluid}. You will numerically study the dynamics produced by bubble bursting in a viscoelastic medium (see \citet{dixit2024viscoelastic}). The numerical results obtained will be compared with the experimental findings from a parallel project. Finally, the implication of our analysis will be made on the understanding of droplet distribution during coughing or sneezing.
